qcdevol
-------

The ``qcdevol`` package implements the QCD evolution of 
couplings, masses, and other renormalization parameters.
Uncertainties can be incorporated into parameters using 
the ``gvar`` module. QED effects can be included. 
There are also tools for manipulating 
and evolving perturbation series.

See the ``INSTALLATION`` file for installation 
directions. Test ``qcdevol`` using ``make tests``.
For documentation, open ``src/html/index.html`` in
