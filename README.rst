qcdevol
-------

The ``qcdevol`` package implements the QCD evolution of 
couplings, masses, and other renormalization parameters.
Uncertainties can be incorporated into parameters using 
the ``gvar`` module. QED effects can be included. 
There are also tools for manipulating 
and evolving perturbation series.

A tutorial on how to use the package is
included in the documentation; documentation is in the ``doc/``
subdirectory: see ``doc/html/index.html`` 
or <https://qcdevol.readthedocs.io>.

See the ``INSTALLATION`` file for installation 
directions. Test ``qcdevol`` using ``make tests``.
For documentation, open ``src/html/index.html`` in 
a browser. Licensing information is in the ``LICENSE``
file.
