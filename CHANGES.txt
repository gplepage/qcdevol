Version 4.0 ????
=================
- First version of qcdevol to be made public.

- Substantial changes from previous versions which 
  are largely incompatible with previous versions.
  In particular the coupling and mass classes 
  have new names and the parameter names are 
  changed. The old names are included to 
  help with legacy code (ie, Alphas 
  instead of the new Alpha_s and Mmsb instead
  of the new M_msb).

- Algorithms are much faster now. Also the 
  code is pure Python and included in its 
  entirety in src/qcdevol/qcdevol.py.
