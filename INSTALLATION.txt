To install:

1. Use 'make install' to install in the system library (or use
	'make install-user' to install in user's library.) Python modules
	numpy and gvar are installed automatically if not present.

	N.B. Rather than using make and the makefile, one can instead use
	standard python installation tools: run 'pip install .' to install
	to the system library (or 'pip install . --user' to install to
	the user's directory) from within the top directory.


2. (Optional) Run 'make tests' to test your installation of qcdevol.
	The tests have been successful if the output ends with "OK".
	
	N.B. The tests can also be run directly using Python's unittest module:
	"python -m unittest discover".


To uninstall:

1. 'make uninstall' uninstalls what was installed. It uses pip uninstall.
